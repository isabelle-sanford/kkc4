re enums: can you have a null state for them? should they be combined with the main class? how do 

note - it looks like if I create an instance of a class and then change something in the class, the instance doesn't update


- maybe make a Money type or at least some helper funcs back and forth

- consider having a field for abilities, lodgings, etc, that's just the "operative number" or whatever (so if we wanted to change the mews insanity bonus it'd only have to happen in one place)

simplifications: 
- ignore Imre 
- ignore actual ability effects 
- ignore items 
- ignore DP 


need using-item actions 

ability questions: 
- is redirect a negative action
- proficient_in_hyperbole probs shouldn't have targets? 
- argumentum_ad_nauseam is probs negative, same with persuasive_arguments
- fae lore is active, is NOT an additional effect on a separate action; not sure what its target is tho 
- 


todo: have fieldStatus contain list of potential masters, in order of time that it happened


going to want to get the 2 targets from PiH from the complaints page, NOT from dropdown from player 

Qs FOR WILSON:
- Persuasive arguments: do you move both your target's votes to the same person? Can you pick to two different people? You can't force them if they have 1/no complaints to vote, right? If they're using Proficient in Hyperbole do all four votes get moved?
- Does using EP to remove IP come before or after elevations? Assuming before, and NPC masters get list with appropriately reduced # of EP. Can PC masters still elevate if you just used all your EP in that field to offset? 
- If you roleblock someone trying for their Pipes, do they not try for them? More generally if you roleblock someone in Imre, what can or can't they still do? 
- What exactly does Ward tell you?
- Can you file EP and then use it to decrease IP instantly / that same turn?
- When Masters are roleblocked, can they still elevate / assign DP? 
- Do we want you to be able to use an item the same turn you buy it? (assuming no)
