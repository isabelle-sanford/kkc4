todo II:
- get_attacked in Player / offensive_actions in Turn 





- webpage is gonna need some random helper funcs for converting money to talents/jots/etc 


todo: have fieldStatus contain list of potential masters, in order of time that it happened


Qs FOR WILSON:
- Persuasive arguments: You can't force them if they have 1/no complaints to vote, right? 


- if you're de-elevated from master can you still do master-level actions (YES)

OoA stuff 
- medica emergency/malfeasance III


flask stuff 
- make Imre player section a diff page (maybe make all player components diff pages?)

notes
- stealing items happens early/first 

stuff not in ooa 
- update # of EP available (during elevating?)
- update vint/aturan stipends during expulsion



particularly notable todos 
- accessible_abilities (MOSTLY DONE)
- tuition (MOSTLY DONE)
- imre (MOSTLY DONE EXCEPT BLACK MARKET)
- action period stuff (PARTLY DONE)
- item stuff (use_item, ids, half items, master-level alchemy items being 2-use)
- results
- naming (sigh)
- customization of results
- sql 
- getting info out of pages into code (figured out)
- offensive / defensive things

abilities
- malfeasance protection nonsense 
- cheating death
- switch stuff to ability2 version
- mommet making
- all linguistics 
- great deals from arithmetics
- law of contraposition, proficient in hyperbole 
- fae lore 
- medica detainment, cheating death
- banned books (incl. getting caught)

small
- destroying locations/fields
- remove createitem category? (probs not)
- add target type specific-item?
- more str / more detailed str (action, actioninfo, playerstatus, ...)
- go over block cycle stuff ffs
- way more error checking everywhere
- insanity bonuses (check over mostly)
- update_choices 
- make sure playerlists are generally of just the living ones
- gm input stuff aside from complaints
- underthing (cannot be targeted or take actions)
- IP offset is 1 IP per FOUR EP
- breakout removes 1 random power (need to get one that's actually a field ability, not using an item)
- failure to do formal apology means 2 DP next turn
- expelled students can only target ppl in Imre or other expelled students
- sabotages kill expelled students unless protected
- masters who cannot pay tuition get demoted 
- making an item over just one turn they can't file complaints or EP or take other actions 
- need to deal with Events (for omen recognition)
- banned books takes two action periods and 2 in one turn has similar effects to item creation
- you can't visit the grey man if you defaulted with giles
- need to figure out what items are worth as collateral in actuality tho 
- blacklisting loaded dice stuff
- loaded dice: make sure cealds/ruh only have option to bet on numbers up thru 6/12 
- masters can unbecome masters if they don't enroll/can't pay tuition, but retain abilities, action periods, whatever
- courier use is immediate (and not an action but does require target + message)
- what happens if you try to take money from a player and it goes negative lol
- do more of game_testing notebook w further cycles 
- js for only showing appropriate target type

- pipes can be given but not stolen
- moneylenders should probably not accrue interest while you're insane

small questions
- if you ask devi for a loan that's more than half your income (maybe unexpectedly), do you get nothing or just the highest loan you can still do? 
- if you buy a gram does it protect you that same turn? (assuming no)
- say you have a 3 talent loan to giles, and it's the last month of a turn. you put in an order to pay giles 2 talents. does that mean you pay your interest first (3 * .15) and the rest is used to pay back part of the original? (currently yes, and the rest of the payback is post stipend recipience)
- if you break out do you count as 'expelled' (or just having-gone-insane) for the purpose of the win conditions
- if you play for your pipes and succeed during the last month of a term, do you get the +10 talents immediately or not until the term after rolls around? 
- do aturans still have a chance of backing out when becoming master?
- if you pickpocket someone with a bodyguard, do you get told that your action failed or succeeded? (same Q for thieves lamp)
- can grams / bodyguards / anything protect from bonetar? (other than H&4)
- if a lodging is destroyed, does the writeup indicate if it went volatile?

action period things:
- anything can be used in a general action period slot 
- any action with an associated field ability can be used in a slot for said field 
- using mommets can take a sympathy action slot 
- anything with create item category can use a createitem AP 
- ??
- how to show UI for that? 


note on pickpocketing: currently, who gets stolen from is weighted by action, not just player, so if you take two actions on the same person you're twice as likely to get pickpocketed. I think that's fine? 



to test:
- who to elevate
- if someone was lashed or whatever, future turns noting being roleblocked
