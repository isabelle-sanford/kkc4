re enums: can you have a null state for them? should they be combined with the main class? how do 

note - it looks like if I create an instance of a class and then change something in the class, the instance doesn't update


- maybe make a Money type or at least some helper funcs back and forth

- consider having a field for abilities, lodgings, etc, that's just the "operative number" or whatever (so if we wanted to change the mews insanity bonus it'd only have to happen in one place)

simplifications: 
- ignore Imre 
- ignore actual ability effects 
- ignore items 
- ignore DP 


need using-item actions 

ability questions: 
- is redirect a negative action
- proficient_in_hyperbole probs shouldn't have targets? 
- argumentum_ad_nauseam is probs negative, same with persuasive_arguments
- fae lore is active, is NOT an additional effect on a separate action; not sure what its target is tho 
- 


todo: have fieldStatus contain list of potential masters, in order of time that it happened


going to want to get the 2 targets from PiH from the complaints page, NOT from dropdown from player 

Qs FOR WILSON:
- Persuasive arguments: do you move both your target's votes to the same person? Can you pick to two different people? You can't force them if they have 1/no complaints to vote, right? If they're using Proficient in Hyperbole do all four votes get moved?


- Does using EP to remove IP come before or after elevations? Assuming before, and NPC masters get list with appropriately reduced # of EP. Can PC masters still elevate if you just used all your EP in that field to offset? 
solution: if using EP to reduce IP, which EP is not specified but will prioritize EP in a field in which you're NOT filing that same turn 

- What exactly does Ward tell you?

- When Masters are roleblocked, can they still elevate / assign DP? - yes unless it's TOTAL
- Do we want you to be able to use an item the same turn you buy it? (assuming no)



- can you be elevated if you're not currently enrolled
- if you're de-elevated from master can you still do master-level actions

OoA stuff 
- if you reduce your IP with EP do NPC masters pick before or after that happens? what abt PC masters? 
- should malfeasance protection downgrades work on ankers roleblock / vint homecoming / etc? 
- should you be able to use an item on the same turn it gets stolen?
- if someone gets elevated and you use school records on them that turn, do you get to see what their newest elevation is in?
- medica emergency/malfeasance III


flask stuff 
- make Imre player section a diff page (maybe make all player components diff pages?)
- are the css files similar / can they be


notes
- stealing items happens early/first 
- medica emergency takes place the NEXT turn
- persuasive arguments changes 1 vote, at random, does not apply to PiH votes
