re enums: can you have a null state for them? should they be combined with the main class? how do 

note - it looks like if I create an instance of a class and then change something in the class, the instance doesn't update


- maybe make a Money type or at least some helper funcs back and forth

- consider having a field for abilities, lodgings, etc, that's just the "operative number" or whatever (so if we wanted to change the mews insanity bonus it'd only have to happen in one place)

simplifications: 
- ignore Imre 
- ignore actual ability effects 
- ignore items 
- ignore DP 


need using-item actions 

ability questions: 
- is redirect a negative action
- proficient_in_hyperbole probs shouldn't have targets? 
- argumentum_ad_nauseam is probs negative, same with persuasive_arguments
- fae lore is active, is NOT an additional effect on a separate action; not sure what its target is tho 
-
