re enums: can you have a null state for them? should they be combined with the main class? how do 

- webpage is gonna need some random helper funcs for converting money to talents/jots/etc 

- consider having a field for abilities, lodgings, etc, that's just the "operative number" or whatever (so if we wanted to change the mews insanity bonus it'd only have to happen in one place)


ability questions: 
- is redirect a negative action (NO)
- proficient_in_hyperbole probs shouldn't have targets? (I think it does but just not player-side)
- argumentum_ad_nauseam is probs negative, same with persuasive_arguments


todo: have fieldStatus contain list of potential masters, in order of time that it happened


Qs FOR WILSON:
- Persuasive arguments: You can't force them if they have 1/no complaints to vote, right? 


- Does using EP to remove IP come before or after elevations? (ELEVATIONS ARE FIRST)
solution: if using EP to reduce IP, which EP you're using is not specified but will prioritize EP in a field in which you're NOT filing that same turn 

- What exactly does Ward tell you? (actiontype?)

- When Masters are roleblocked, can they still elevate / assign DP? - yes unless it's TOTAL (and in that case they don't get the tuition bump if they still put in the order and just got blocked from doing it)
- Do we want you to be able to use an item the same turn you buy/receive it? (no)


- can you be elevated if you're not currently enrolled
- if you're de-elevated from master can you still do master-level actions (YES)

OoA stuff 
- should malfeasance protection downgrades work on ankers roleblock / vint homecoming / etc? (NO)
- should you be able to use an item on the same turn it gets stolen? (NO)
- if someone gets elevated and you use school records on them that turn, do you get to see what their newest elevation is in? (NO)
- medica emergency/malfeasance III


flask stuff 
- make Imre player section a diff page (maybe make all player components diff pages?)
- are the css files similar / can they be


notes
- stealing items happens early/first 
- medica emergency takes place the NEXT turn
- persuasive arguments changes 1 vote, at random, does not apply to PiH votes


stuff not in ooa 
- update # of EP available (during elevating?)
- update vint/aturan stipends during expulsion
