re enums: can you have a null state for them? should they be combined with the main class? how do 

- webpage is gonna need some random helper funcs for converting money to talents/jots/etc 

- consider having a field for abilities, lodgings, etc, that's just the "operative number" or whatever (so if we wanted to change the mews insanity bonus it'd only have to happen in one place)


ability questions: 
- is redirect a negative action (NO)
- proficient_in_hyperbole probs shouldn't have targets? (I think it does but just not player-side)
- argumentum_ad_nauseam is probs negative, same with persuasive_arguments


todo: have fieldStatus contain list of potential masters, in order of time that it happened


Qs FOR WILSON:
- Persuasive arguments: You can't force them if they have 1/no complaints to vote, right? 


- Does using EP to remove IP come before or after elevations? (ELEVATIONS ARE FIRST)
solution: if using EP to reduce IP, which EP you're using is not specified but will prioritize EP in a field in which you're NOT filing that same turn 

- What exactly does Ward tell you? (actiontype?)

- When Masters are roleblocked, can they still elevate / assign DP? - yes unless it's TOTAL (and in that case they don't get the tuition bump if they still put in the order and just got blocked from doing it)
- Do we want you to be able to use an item the same turn you buy/receive it? (no)


- can you be elevated if you're not currently enrolled
- if you're de-elevated from master can you still do master-level actions (YES)

OoA stuff 
- should malfeasance protection downgrades work on ankers roleblock / vint homecoming / etc? (NO)
- should you be able to use an item on the same turn it gets stolen? (NO)
- if someone gets elevated and you use school records on them that turn, do you get to see what their newest elevation is in? (NO)
- medica emergency/malfeasance III


flask stuff 
- make Imre player section a diff page (maybe make all player components diff pages?)
- are the css files similar / can they be


notes
- stealing items happens early/first 
- medica emergency takes place the NEXT turn
- persuasive arguments changes 1 vote, at random, does not apply to PiH votes


stuff not in ooa 
- update # of EP available (during elevating?)
- update vint/aturan stipends during expulsion



particularly notable todos 
- accessible_abilities
- tuition (MOSTLY DONE)
- imre (MOSTLY DONE EXCEPT BLACK MARKET)
- action period stuff
- item stuff (use_item, ids, half items, master-level alchemy items being 2-use)
- results
- naming (sigh)
- customization of results
- sql 
- getting info out of pages into code :))
- offensive / defensive things

abilities
- malfeasance protection nonsense 
- cheating death
- switch stuff to ability2 version
- mommet making
- all linguistics 
- arithmetics passives
- law of contraposition, proficient in hyperbole 
- fae lore 
- medica detainment, cheating death
- banned books (incl. getting caught)

small
- destroying locations/fields
- remove createitem category? 
- add target type specific-item?
- more str / more detailed str (action, actioninfo, playerstatus, ...)
- go over block cycle stuff ffs
- way more error checking everywhere
- insanity bonuses (check over mostly)
- update_choices 
- make sure playerlists are generally of just the living ones
- gm input stuff aside from complaints
- make mastery/elevation less ugly
    - also, pc master choice takes precedence over npc
- underthing (cannot be targeted or take actions)
- IP offset is 1 IP per FOUR EP
- breakout removes 1 random power
- failure to do formal apology means 2 DP next turn
- expelled students can only target ppl in Imre or other expelled students
- sabotages kill expelled students unless protected
- multiple masters try to elevate a student -> field where they have MORE EP takes precedence
- masters who cannot pay tuition get demoted 
- making an item over just one turn they can't file complaints or EP or take other actions 
- need to deal with Events (for omen recognition)
- banned books takes two action periods and 2 in one turn has similar effects to item creation
- you can't visit the grey man if you defaulted with giles
- need to figure out what items are worth as collateral in actuality tho 
- blacklisting loaded dice stuff
- loaded dice: make sure cealds/ruh only have option to bet on numbers up thru 6/12 
- talent pipe stipend
- masters can unbecome masters if they don't enroll/can't pay tuition, but retain abilities, action periods, whatever

- pipes can be given but not stolen
- moneylenders should probably not accrue interest while you're insane

small questions
- if you ask devi for a loan that's more than half your income (maybe unexpectedly), do you get nothing or just the highest loan you can still do? 
- if you buy a gram does it protect you that same turn? (assuming no)
- say you have a 3 talent loan to giles, and it's the last month of a turn. you put in an order to pay giles 2 talents. does that mean you pay your interest first (3 * .15) and the rest is used to pay back part of the original? (currently yes, and the rest of the payback is post stipend recipience)
- if you break out do you count as 'expelled' (or just having-gone-insane) for the purpose of the win conditions
- if you play for your pipes and succeed during the last month of a term, do you get the +10 talents immediately or not until the term after rolls around?
